# Customer-Analytics
## Objectives
This project focuses on classic scoring activity (regularly carried out for customer acquisition). Teach for 
America is the organization in discussion. It gives us a list of 3748 names of recent graduates to whom they 
have made job offers. TFA's difficulty is a lack of understanding regarding which characteristics most 
substantially impact recent graduates' decision to matriculate when they get offers from their corps; in other 
words, they want to know which applicants are most likely to accept their offer. Furthermore, because TFA 
typically has fixed capacity in each recruiting cycle, they want to know how many recent grads they may 
issue offers to in order to avoid the number of applicants eventually joining the corps exceeding their 
opening spots. Our team opted to utilize the Binary Logit Model to examine the relationship between 
matriculation and a set of factors, and List Scoring to forecast each candidate's likelihood of matriculation 
as well as who TFA should extend an offer to.
